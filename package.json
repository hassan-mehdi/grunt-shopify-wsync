  "readme": "This npm package is based on the work by Will Rossiter (wilr, https://github.com/wilr/grunt-shopify). \r\n\r\nHe most definitely put all the leg work in, I just added a sync option so I can pull changes from live themes into preview themes.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nThis package is built to simulate a proper dev workflow, live environment and staging environment. Live theme and a staging theme. \r\n\r\nThe sync option means you can pull any updates made on the live theme into the staging theme.\r\n\r\nI CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, This is a package made for my own personal use and I will in no way provide support.\r\n\r\nIf you do come across this you are more than very welcome to use it:\r\n\r\ngrunt-contrib-watch is required\r\n\r\nThis is the basic gruntfile:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = function(grunt){\r\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-watch');\r\n  grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-shopify-wsync');\r\n\r\n  grunt.initConfig({\r\n     shopify: {\r\n      options: {\r\n        //You can find these in your Shopify Admin under Apps then look at the bottom for Create a private API Key\r\n          api_key: \"###################\",\r\n          password: \"####################\",\r\n          url: \"########.myshopify.com\",\r\n          //The directory you want your theme to download to on your local machine\r\n          base: 'theme/',\r\n          //Theme id for the non-live theme, this is where local changes are made and get pushed to shopify when you save (grunt-contrib-watch)\r\n          theme: '######',\r\n          //Theme id for the Live theme, Live is always the theme you sync from not to, you have been warned!\r\n          sync: '######'\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    watch: {\r\n      shopify: {\r\n        files: ['theme/**'],\r\n        tasks: [\"shopify\"]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  grunt.registerTask('default', ['shopify']);\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo download the non-live theme (staging theme) from Shopify\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngrunt shopify:download\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo download the live theme and overwrite the non-live theme on your local machine\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngrunt shopify:sync\r\n```",
